# Microservices-Design-Patterns: Strangler-Pattern Example

#Scenario:

The legacy system handles customer information through an old service.

We want to incrementally migrate to a new microservice architecture using the Strangler Fig Pattern.

The system will decide, based on business logic, whether to use the legacy service or the new microservice.
